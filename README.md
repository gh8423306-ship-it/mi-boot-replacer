# MiPad Custom Boot Animation
English | [简体中文](/README_zh-CN.md)

## Introduction
A simple module designed exclusively for tablet devices, replacing the boot animations with custom ones. Unlike phones, tablets often adapt their animations based on device orientation.

## Requirements
- Magisk v26.1+ / KernelSU v0.8.0+ / APatch 10568+
- Android 11+ (API 30+)
> [!WARNING]
> This module is designed for Magisk. KernelSU and APatch are not fully supported and unexpected bugs may occur.

> [!NOTE]
> This module should work on other tablet models, brands, and systems, but further testing is needed. Feel free to report your results!

## Installation

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not directly download and flash the releases unless you want to manually replace the bootanimation files yourself. Use the **GitHub Actions workflow** below to build a module with your own animations.

1. Use the [GitHub Actions workflow](#github-actions-build-your-own-module) to build your custom module
2. Download the built module from Artifacts
3. Flash .zip module in the Magisk / KernelSU / APatch app

> [!TIP]
> If you get a blank screen after adding your own animation, it's likely because the ZIP file wasn't compressed right. Use "store-only" mode (no compression) when creating the ZIP.

## To-Dos
1. ~~Add GitHub Actions workflow for automated module building~~ (Done)
2. Auto detect and select path for corresponding models

## GitHub Actions (Build Your Own Module)

You can use GitHub Actions to build a custom boot animation module without any local tools! The workflow automatically downloads the latest release as a base.

### Method 1: Fork and Upload Files

1. **Fork** this repository
2. Add your `bootanimation.zip` files to the `bootanimations/` folder
3. Commit and push your changes
4. Go to **Actions** → **"Build Custom Boot Animation Module"**
5. Click **"Run workflow"**
6. Select the **Target location** for your bootanimation files
7. Download the built module from **Artifacts**

### Method 2: Use Direct URLs

1. Go to **Actions** → **"Build Custom Boot Animation Module"**
2. Click **"Run workflow"**
3. Select the **Target location**
4. Enter direct download URLs to your bootanimation files (comma-separated)
5. Download the built module from **Artifacts**

### Available Target Locations

| Location | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `system/product/media` | Default location (most devices) |
| `system/media` | Legacy location |
| `system/system_ext/media` | System extension media |
| `system/product/media/theme/default` | Theme default location |

### File Naming Convention

- `bootanimation.zip` - Main boot animation
- `bootanimation01.zip` - Alternative 1 (rotation variant)
- `bootanimation02.zip` - Alternative 2
- ... and so on

### Bootanimation File Requirements

Each `bootanimation.zip` should contain:

```
bootanimation.zip
├── desc.txt          # Required: Animation descriptor
├── part0/            # Required: First animation part
│   ├── 00000.png
│   ├── 00001.png
│   └── ...
├── part1/            # Optional: Second animation part
│   ├── 00000.png
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

#### desc.txt Format

```
<width> <height> <fps>
<type> <count> <pause> <path>
...
```

Example:
```
1080 1920 60
c 1 0 part0
c 0 0 part1
```

- `c` = Play complete (or `p` = play and repeat)
- First number = loop count (0 = infinite)
- Second number = pause after loop (in frames)
- Path = folder containing the frames

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Bootanimation ZIP files **must** use STORE compression (no compression). The workflow handles this automatically.

**Flashing this module may cause your device to bootloop, a bootloop saver module is highly recommended. I am not responsible for any damages caused to your device or data by using this module. Use at your own risk.**
